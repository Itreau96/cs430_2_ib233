## Purpose ##

The purpose of this project is to create a simple raycaster that will display 3d shapes in an image file. This project uses various mathematical equations to correctly project the shapes onto the image plane. We make use of our own 3d math libraries in this project in order to simplify the raycast process. The output file is in P6 .ppm format. 

## Contents ##

The contents of the project repository are as follows:
- Source code written in C programming language
- A Makefile used to build the project
- A sample program build
- Sample input/output files to be used with the sample build

## Usage ##

Steps to use: 

1. Extract the source folder provided.
2. Using a command line interface, navigate to the source folder directory.
3. Type "Make" in the command line to create the executable.
4. Type "./raycast width height input.csv output.ppm". 

## Known Issues ##
