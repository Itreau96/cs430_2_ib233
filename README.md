## Purpose ##

The purpose of this project is to create a simple raycaster that will display 3d shapes in an image file. This project uses various mathematical equations to correctly project the shapes onto the image plane. We make use of our own 3d math libraries in this project in order to simplify the raycast process.

## Contents ##

The contents of the project repository are as follows:
- Source code written in C programming language
- A Makefile used to build the project
- A sample program build
- Sample input/output files to be used with the sample build
